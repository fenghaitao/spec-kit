# Feature Specification: [FEATURE NAME]

**Feature Branch**: `[###-feature-name]`  
**Created**: [DATE]  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "$ARGUMENTS"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- **Simics sections**: Include only for hardware device modeling projects
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
[Describe the main user journey in plain language]

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** [initial state], **When** [action], **Then** [expected outcome]
2. **Given** [initial state], **When** [action], **Then** [expected outcome]

### Edge Cases
- What happens when [boundary condition]?
- How does system handle [error scenario]?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST [specific capability, e.g., "allow users to create accounts"]
- **FR-002**: System MUST [specific capability, e.g., "validate email addresses"]  
- **FR-003**: Users MUST be able to [key interaction, e.g., "reset their password"]
- **FR-004**: System MUST [data requirement, e.g., "persist user preferences"]
- **FR-005**: System MUST [behavior, e.g., "log all security events"]

*Example of marking unclear requirements:*
- **FR-006**: System MUST authenticate users via [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: auth method not specified - email/password, SSO, OAuth?]
- **FR-007**: System MUST retain user data for [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: retention period not specified]

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **[Entity 1]**: [What it represents, key attributes without implementation]
- **[Entity 2]**: [What it represents, relationships to other entities]

### Hardware Specification *(Simics projects only)*

**Device Overview**:
- **Device Type**: [e.g., PCI Network controller, I2C Storage device, Memory-mapped Memory controller]
- **Base Address**: [e.g., 0x1000, dynamically assigned, or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]
- **Address Space Size**: [e.g., 4KB, 64 registers, or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]
- **External Interfaces**: [Ports, bus connections, interrupt lines, DMA channels the device exposes]

**Register Map** *(use table format for each register)*:

| Offset | Name | Size | Access | Reset | Purpose |
|--------|------|------|--------|-------|---------|
| 0x00 | CONTROL | 32-bit | R/W | 0x0000 | Device control and enable flags |
| 0x04 | STATUS | 32-bit | R/O | 0x0001 | Device status indicators |
| 0x08 | DATA | 32-bit | R/W | 0x0000 | Data transfer register |
| ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... |

*For each register with bit fields, detail the fields:*

**CONTROL Register (0x00)** bit fields:
- Bits [31:8]: Reserved (must be 0)
- Bit 7: INTERRUPT_ENABLE (R/W) - Enable interrupt generation
- Bit 6: DMA_ENABLE (R/W) - Enable DMA transfers
- Bits [5:1]: Reserved
- Bit 0: DEVICE_ENABLE (R/W) - Master enable for device operation

**STATUS Register (0x04)** bit fields:
- Bits [31:4]: Reserved
- Bit 3: ERROR (R/O) - Error condition detected
- Bit 2: BUSY (R/O) - Device busy processing
- Bit 1: INTERRUPT_PENDING (R/O) - Interrupt waiting to be serviced
- Bit 0: READY (R/O) - Device ready for operations

*Continue for all registers...*

**Operational Behavior**:
- **Initialization**: [Sequence of register writes needed to initialize device, e.g., "Write 0x1 to CONTROL.DEVICE_ENABLE"]
- **Normal Operation**: [Key register interactions during typical use, e.g., "Write data to DATA register, then set CONTROL.START_TRANSFER"]
- **Error Handling**: [How errors are signaled and cleared, e.g., "STATUS.ERROR set on failure, write 1 to CONTROL.CLEAR_ERROR to reset"]
- **Interrupts**: [When interrupts fire and how to acknowledge, e.g., "Interrupt fires when STATUS.INTERRUPT_PENDING=1, clear by reading STATUS"]

**Software Visibility**:
- [What aspects of device behavior are observable from software]
- [What internal state is NOT visible to software]
- [Timing constraints or ordering requirements for register access]

**Examples of marking unclear specifications**:
- **Base Address**: [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Is this PCI BAR-based or fixed memory-mapped?]
- **CONTROL.RESERVED bits**: [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Should writes to reserved bits be ignored or cause errors?]
- **Interrupt line**: [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Which interrupt line number or dynamically assigned?]
