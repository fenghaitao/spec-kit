# Device Model Specification: [DEVICE_NAME]

**Feature Branch**: `[###-device-name]`  
**Created**: [DATE]  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: Device description: "$ARGUMENTS"

## Execution Flow (simics-device)
```
1. Parse device description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No device description provided"
2. Extract device characteristics from description
   ‚Üí Identify: device type, interfaces, behavioral requirements, performance constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill Device Behavioral Model section
   ‚Üí If no clear behavior: ERROR "Cannot determine device functionality"
5. Generate Register Interface Specifications
   ‚Üí Each register must be clearly defined
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous register definitions
6. Define Memory Interface Requirements
7. Specify Simics Interface Implementation needs
8. Generate Validation Scenarios
9. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
10. Return: SUCCESS (device spec ready for implementation planning)
```

## ‚ö° Device Modeling Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on BEHAVIOR and INTERFACES the device provides
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement in DML/Python (no code structure, specific API calls)
- üîß Written for hardware architects and simulation developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every device model
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the device
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a device description:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption needed
2. **Don't guess interface details**: If description doesn't specify register layout, mark it
3. **Think like a validator**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" check
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - Register bit field definitions and access patterns
   - Memory address space requirements
   - Interface timing and synchronization requirements
   - Reset and initialization behavior
   - Error handling and exception conditions
   - Performance and power requirements
