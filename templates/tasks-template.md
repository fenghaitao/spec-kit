# Tasks: [FEATURE NAME]

**Status**: Not Started | In Progress | Completed | Blocked

(Status changes to 'In Progress' when first task starts, 'Completed' when all tasks done, 'Blocked' if waiting on dependencies)

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/[###-feature-name]/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), research.md, data-model.md, contracts/

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Load plan.md from feature directory
   → If not found: ERROR "No implementation plan found"
   → Extract: tech stack, libraries, structure
2. Load optional design documents:
   → data-model.md: Extract entities → model tasks
   → contracts/: Each file → contract test task
   → research.md: Extract decisions → setup tasks
   → **Simics projects**: Extract register definitions → DML file tasks (after project structure is generated by MCP server)
3. Generate tasks by category:
   → Setup: project init, dependencies, linting
   → Tests: contract tests, integration tests
   → Core: models, services, CLI commands
   → Integration: DB, middleware, logging
   → Polish: unit tests, performance, docs
4. Apply task rules:
   → Different files = mark [P] for parallel
   → Same file = sequential (no [P])
   → Tests before implementation (TDD)
5. Number tasks sequentially (T001, T002...)
6. Generate dependency graph
7. Create parallel execution examples
8. Validate task completeness:
   → All contracts have tests?
   → All entities have models?
   → All endpoints implemented?
9. Return: SUCCESS (tasks ready for execution)
```

## Format: `[ID] [P?] Description`
- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions
- **Single project**: `src/`, `tests/` at repository root
- **Web app**: `backend/src/`, `frontend/src/`
- **Mobile**: `api/src/`, `ios/src/` or `android/src/`
- **Simics**: `simics-project/modules/device-name/`, `simics-project/modules/device-name/test/` at repository root
- Paths shown below assume single project - adjust based on plan.md structure

## CRITICAL: Path Handling for MCP Tools
When using MCP tools (like Simics build tools), **ALWAYS** use ABSOLUTE PATHS:
- ❌ WRONG: `project_path="./simics-project"` (relative path - will resolve in MCP server's directory)
- ✅ CORRECT: `project_path="<ABSOLUTE_PATH_TO_PROJECT>/simics-project"` (absolute path - works correctly)
- The implement agent MUST replace `<ABSOLUTE_PATH_TO_PROJECT>` with the actual absolute path from the working directory
- Example: If working dir is `/home/user/myproject`, use `project_path="/home/user/myproject/simics-project"`

## Phase 3.1: Setup
- [ ] T001 Create project structure per implementation plan
- [ ] T002 Initialize [language] project with [framework] dependencies
- [ ] T003 [P] Configure linting and formatting tools

**Simics Setup Example:**

- [ ] T003 Add device skeleton using `add_dml_device_skeleton(project_path="<ABSOLUTE_PATH_TO_PROJECT>/simics-project", device_name="DEVICE_NAME")`
- [ ] T004 [P] Verify project structure and build system using `build_simics_project(project_path="<ABSOLUTE_PATH_TO_PROJECT>/simics-project", module="DEVICE_NAME")`
- [ ] T005 **GATE**: Verify research.md from /plan phase exists and contains required documentation
  * Check file existence: FEATURE_DIR/../research.md
  * Verify required RAG results present (DML reference, Model Builder patterns, device templates, device-specific best practices, register patterns, test patterns)
  * Identify any gaps requiring additional queries
  * Document gap-filling queries as additional tasks if needed
- [ ] T006 [P] **RAG SEARCH**: Use `perform_rag_query("DML 1.4 language syntax basics", source_type="docs", match_count=5)` OR `ask_dmlbot("DML 1.4 language syntax basics")` for DML language fundamentals (MANDATORY)
- [ ] T007 [P] **RAG SEARCH**: Use `perform_rag_query("Python test register access SIM_create_object dev_util expect_equal stest", source_type="python", match_count=5)` OR `ask_dmlbot("Python test register access patterns")` for test implementation guidance (OPTIONAL - if research.md insufficient)
- [ ] T008 [P] **RAG SEARCH**: Use `perform_rag_query("Simics device testing validation strategy test suite organization", source_type="source", match_count=5)` OR `ask_dmlbot("Simics device testing best practices")` for test strategy patterns (OPTIONAL - if research.md insufficient)
- [ ] T009 [P] **RAG SEARCH**: Use `perform_rag_query("DML 1.4 register bank read write get set method implementation", source_type="dml", match_count=5)` OR `ask_dmlbot("DML 1.4 register bank implementation")` for detailed implementation guidance (OPTIONAL - if research.md insufficient)
- [ ] T010 [P] **RAG SEARCH**: Use `perform_rag_query("DML device attribute state saved session checkpointing", source_type="dml", match_count=5)` OR `ask_dmlbot("DML device state and checkpointing")` for state handling patterns (OPTIONAL - if research.md insufficient)
- [ ] T011 [P] **RAG SEARCH**: Use `perform_rag_query("DML 1.4 implement connect interface port io_memory signal", source_type="dml", match_count=5)` OR `ask_dmlbot("DML interface and port implementation")` for interface implementation guidance (OPTIONAL - if research.md insufficient)
- [ ] T012 [P] **RAG SEARCH**: Use `perform_rag_query("DML event after cycle callback post cancel time management", source_type="dml", match_count=5)` OR `ask_dmlbot("DML event handling and timing")` for event handling patterns (OPTIONAL - if research.md insufficient)

## Phase 3.2: Tests First (TDD) ⚠️ MUST COMPLETE BEFORE 3.3
**CRITICAL: These tests MUST be written and MUST FAIL before ANY implementation**
- [ ] T004 [P] Contract test POST /api/users in tests/contract/test_users_post.py
- [ ] T005 [P] Contract test GET /api/users/{id} in tests/contract/test_users_get.py

- [ ] T007 [P] Integration test auth flow in tests/integration/test_auth.py

**Simics TDD Example:**
- [ ] T013 [P] Register access test in simics-project/modules/device-name/test/s-registers.py (reference test patterns from research.md and RAG results)
- [ ] T014 [P] Interface behavior test in simics-project/modules/device-name/test/s-interfaces.py (reference interface patterns from research.md and RAG results)
- [ ] T015 [P] Device workflow test in simics-project/modules/device-name/test/s-device-name.py (main test file, reference device patterns from research.md and RAG results)
- [ ] T016 [P] Set up and validate test environment using `run_simics_test(project_path="<ABSOLUTE_PATH_TO_PROJECT>/simics-project", suite="modules/DEVICE_NAME/test")`

## Phase 3.3: Core Implementation (ONLY after tests are failing)
- [ ] T008 [P] User model in src/models/user.py
- [ ] T009 [P] UserService CRUD in src/services/user_service.py
- [ ] T010 [P] CLI --create-user in src/cli/user_commands.py
- [ ] T011 POST /api/users endpoint
- [ ] T012 GET /api/users/{id} endpoint
- [ ] T013 Input validation
- [ ] T014 Error handling and logging

**Simics Implementation Example:**

- [ ] T023 Error handling and logging for device operations
- [ ] T024 [P] Incremental build validation using `build_simics_project(project_path="<ABSOLUTE_PATH_TO_PROJECT>/simics-project", module="DEVICE_NAME")`

## Phase 3.4: Integration
- [ ] T015 Connect UserService to DB
- [ ] T016 Auth middleware
- [ ] T017 Request/response logging
- [ ] T018 CORS and security headers

**Simics Integration Example:**
- [ ] T034 **RAG SEARCH**: Use `perform_rag_query("DML device memory map transact interrupt signal integration patterns", source_type="dml", match_count=5)` OR `ask_dmlbot("DML memory map and interrupt integration")` for integration patterns
- [ ] T035 Connect device to memory interface using transact() methods
- [ ] T036 Implement interrupt line connections and events
- [ ] T037 Add external port communications and protocols
- [ ] T038 Integrate with Simics checkpointing and state management
- [ ] T039 [P] Validate integration with `build_simics_project(project_path="<ABSOLUTE_PATH_TO_PROJECT>/simics-project")`
- [ ] T040 [P] Run comprehensive tests using `run_simics_test(project_path="<ABSOLUTE_PATH_TO_PROJECT>/simics-project", suite="modules/DEVICE_NAME/test")`

## Phase 3.5: Polish

- [ ] T020 Performance tests (<200ms)
- [ ] T021 [P] Update docs/api.md
- [ ] T022 Remove duplication

## Dependencies
- Tests (T004-T007) before implementation (T008-T014)
- T008 blocks T009, T015
- T016 blocks T018
- Implementation before polish (T019-T023)

### Simics Dependencies
- MCP server connection (T001) before project creation (T002)
- Project structure (T002) before device skeleton (T003)
- Device skeleton (T003) before build validation (T004)
- Build validation (T004) before research review (T005)
- Research review (T005) before knowledge preparation (T006-T012)
- DML fundamentals (T006): RAG query for basic DML 1.4 grammar and syntax
- Test knowledge preparation (T007-T008): RAG queries for Python test patterns and best practices
- Implementation knowledge preparation (T009-T012): RAG queries for DML implementation patterns (registers, state, interfaces, events)
- Knowledge preparation (T006-T012) before test implementation (T013-T016)
- Tests (T013-T016) before implementation (T017-T024)
- Device structure review (T017) before register/interface implementation (T018-T019)
- Device implementation (T017-T024) references patterns from research.md and RAG results
- Error recovery RAG queries executed only when build errors occur

## Parallel Example
```
# Launch T004-T007 together:
Task: "Contract test POST /api/users in tests/contract/test_users_post.py"
Task: "Contract test GET /api/users/{id} in tests/contract/test_users_get.py"
Task: "Integration test registration in tests/integration/test_registration.py"
Task: "Integration test auth in tests/integration/test_auth.py"
```

## Notes
- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies
- Verify tests fail before implementing
- Commit after each task
- Avoid: vague tasks, same file conflicts

## Task Generation Rules
*Applied during main() execution*

1. **From Contracts**:
   - Each contract file → contract test task [P]
   - Each endpoint → implementation task
   - **Simics**: Each register interface → register test task [P]

2. **From Data Model**:
   - Each entity → model creation task [P]
   - Relationships → service layer tasks
   - **Simics**: Each register group → DML file task [P]

3. **From User Stories**:
   - Each story → integration test [P]
   - Quickstart scenarios → validation tasks
   - **Simics**: Each device workflow → operational test [P]

4. **Ordering**:
   - Setup → Tests → Models → Services → Endpoints → Polish
   - **Simics**: MCP Setup → Tests → Registers → Interfaces → Device → Integration → Validation → Polish
   - Dependencies block parallel execution
   - **Simics MCP Tools**: Use at each validation step for continuous integration

## Validation Checklist
*GATE: Checked by main() before returning*

- [ ] All contracts have corresponding tests
- [ ] All entities have model tasks
- [ ] All tests come before implementation
- [ ] Parallel tasks truly independent
- [ ] Each task specifies exact file path
- [ ] No task modifies same file as another [P] task

**Simics-Specific Validation:**
- [ ] All MCP tool calls specify correct project_path
- [ ] Build validation tasks after implementation changes
- [ ] Test execution tasks use appropriate suite parameter
- [ ] Device name consistently used across MCP tool calls
- [ ] research.md from /plan phase is available and referenced
- [ ] Optional RAG searches are only used when research.md is insufficient
- [ ] All new RAG search results are documented

## research.md Workflow

**Source**: research.md created by /plan phase with comprehensive RAG results

**Usage in /tasks**:
- Reference documented patterns in task descriptions
- Use research.md as primary knowledge source
- Only create gap-filling tasks if research.md lacks specific details

**Modifications**:
- If gaps found: Create tasks to fill gaps with additional RAG queries
- New RAG results: Append to research.md, don't replace existing content
- Never delete /plan phase RAG results

**Missing research.md**: ERROR - /plan phase must complete before /tasks

## Critical Prerequisites Gate
**⚠️ MANDATORY: research.md from /plan phase MUST be available before proceeding to Phase 3.2 (Tests)**

### Pre-Test Phase Gate Checklist:
- [ ] **GATE**: research.md file exists and is accessible from /plan phase
- [ ] **GATE T005**: research.md contains documented RAG results for:
  * DML 1.4 Reference Manual (source_type="docs")
  * Model Builder User Guide (source_type="docs")
  * DML Device Template (source_type="dml")
  * Device-Specific Best Practices (source_type="source")
  * Simics Device Reference Example (source_type="source")
  * Register Implementation Patterns (source_type="dml")
  * Simics Python Test Patterns (source_type="python")
  * Device Testing Best Practices (source_type="source")
- [ ] **GATE T005**: Reviewed research.md and understood the documented patterns and examples
- [ ] **GATE T005**: Identified which patterns from research.md apply to this specific implementation

### Execution Validation Rules:
1. **Prerequisites First**: T005 MUST verify research.md exists and contains all required RAG results from /plan phase
2. **Research Reference**: Implementation tasks should reference patterns documented in research.md
3. **Optional RAG Queries**: T010 and T015 are OPTIONAL - only use if research.md lacks specific implementation details
4. **New Query Documentation**: Any new RAG queries during tasks phase must be documented and added to research.md
5. **Blocking Dependency**: No Phase 3.2+ tasks can proceed until research.md is verified and reviewed

### Common Execution Failures:
- ❌ **Ignoring research.md**: Running duplicate RAG queries instead of using research.md from /plan phase
- ❌ **Skipping review**: Proceeding to implementation without reviewing documented patterns in research.md
- ❌ **Missing prerequisites**: Starting tasks without verifying /plan phase completed and generated research.md
- ❌ **Unnecessary queries**: Running RAG queries for information already documented in research.md
- ✅ **Correct approach**: Verify research.md exists → Review documented patterns → Reference during implementation → Only query if gaps exist

**Simics Error Recovery Rules:**
1. **If `build_simics_project` fails with syntax error**:
   - First, check research.md for relevant DML patterns and examples
   - If research.md lacks specific error-related examples, extract the syntax error keyword
   - Call `perform_rag_query(query="Examples of [syntax_error_keyword] in Simics DML 1.4", source_type="dml")` OR `ask_dmlbot("How to fix [syntax_error_keyword] in DML 1.4")`
   - Document the new RAG results before attempting to fix the DML files
   - Example: For "unknown attribute" error → check research.md first → query only if needed

2. **If `run_simics_test` fails**:
   - First, check research.md for relevant test patterns
   - If research.md lacks specific error-related examples, extract the failure keyword
   - Call `perform_rag_query(query="Example of [test_failure_keyword] in Simics Python tests", source_type="python")` OR `ask_dmlbot("How to fix [test_failure_keyword] in Simics tests")`
   - Document the new RAG results before attempting to fix the tests
   - Example: For "AttributeError" → check research.md first → query only if needed
