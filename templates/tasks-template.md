# Tasks: [FEATURE NAME]

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/[###-feature-name]/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), research.md, data-model.md, contracts/

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Load plan.md from feature directory
   → If not found: ERROR "No implementation plan found"
   → Extract: tech stack, libraries, structure
2. Load optional design documents:
   → data-model.md: Extract entities → model tasks
   → contracts/: Each file → contract test task
   → research.md: Extract decisions → setup tasks
   → **Simics projects**: Extract register definitions → DML file tasks (after project structure is generated by MCP server)
3. Generate tasks by category:
   → Setup: project init, dependencies, linting
   → Tests: contract tests, integration tests
   → Core: models, services, CLI commands
   → Integration: DB, middleware, logging
   → Polish: unit tests, performance, docs
4. Apply task rules:
   → Different files = mark [P] for parallel
   → Same file = sequential (no [P])
   → Tests before implementation (TDD)
5. Number tasks sequentially (T001, T002...)
6. Generate dependency graph
7. Create parallel execution examples
8. Validate task completeness:
   → All contracts have tests?
   → All entities have models?
   → All endpoints implemented?
9. Return: SUCCESS (tasks ready for execution)
```

## Format: `[ID] [P?] Description`
- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions
- **Single project**: `src/`, `tests/` at repository root
- **Web app**: `backend/src/`, `frontend/src/`
- **Mobile**: `api/src/`, `ios/src/` or `android/src/`
- **Simics**: `./simics-project/modules/device-name/`, `./simics-project/modules/device-name/test/` at repository root
- Paths shown below assume single project - adjust based on plan.md structure

## Phase 3.1: Setup
- [ ] T001 Create project structure per implementation plan
- [ ] T002 Initialize [language] project with [framework] dependencies
- [ ] T003 [P] Configure linting and formatting tools

**Simics Setup Example:**
- [ ] T001 Create Simics project structure using `create_simics_project(project_path="./simics-project")`
- [ ] T002 Add device skeleton using `add_dml_device_skeleton(project_path="./simics-project", device_name="DEVICE_NAME")`
- [ ] T003 [P] Verify project structure and build system using `build_simics_project(project_path="./simics-project", module="DEVICE_NAME")`

**NOTE**: Discovery and documentation MCP tools (`get_simics_version()`, `list_installed_packages()`, `list_simics_platforms()`, `pageindex_rag_query_drm(string)`, ``pageindex_rag_query_model_builder(string)`, `get_simics_dml_template()`, `get_simics_device_example_i2c()`, `get_simics_device_example_ds12887()`) were already executed during Phase 0 of /plan command. Their outputs are documented in research.md and informed the design in data-model.md and contracts/.

## Phase 3.2: Tests First (TDD) ⚠️ MUST COMPLETE BEFORE 3.3
**CRITICAL: These tests MUST be written and MUST FAIL before ANY implementation**
- [ ] T004 [P] Contract test POST /api/users in tests/contract/test_users_post.py
- [ ] T005 [P] Contract test GET /api/users/{id} in tests/contract/test_users_get.py
- [ ] T006 [P] Integration test user registration in tests/integration/test_registration.py
- [ ] T007 [P] Integration test auth flow in tests/integration/test_auth.py

**Simics TDD Example:**
- [ ] T004 [P] Register access test in simics-project/modules/device-name/test/s-registers.py (using test patterns from research.md python_test_samples_path analysis)
- [ ] T005 [P] Interface behavior test in simics-project/modules/device-name/test/s-interfaces.py
- [ ] T006 [P] Device workflow test in simics-project/modules/device-name/test/s-device-name.py (main test file)
- [ ] T007 [P] Validate tests fail as expected using `run_simics_test(project_path="./simics-project", suite="modules/DEVICE_NAME/test")`

## Phase 3.3: Core Implementation (ONLY after tests are failing)
- [ ] T008 [P] User model in src/models/user.py
- [ ] T009 [P] UserService CRUD in src/services/user_service.py
- [ ] T010 [P] CLI --create-user in src/cli/user_commands.py
- [ ] T011 POST /api/users endpoint
- [ ] T012 GET /api/users/{id} endpoint
- [ ] T013 Input validation
- [ ] T014 Error handling and logging

**Simics Implementation Example:**
- [ ] T008 [P] Register definitions in simics-project/modules/device-name/registers.dml (from data-model.md Register Definitions)
- [ ] T009 [P] Interface declarations in simics-project/modules/device-name/interfaces.dml (from data-model.md Interfaces)
- [ ] T010 [P] Utility methods in simics-project/modules/device-name/utility.dml
- [ ] T011 [P] Build device module using `build_simics_project(project_path="./simics-project", module="DEVICE_NAME")`
- [ ] T012 Main device structure in simics-project/modules/device-name/device-name.dml (from data-model.md Device State)
- [ ] T013 Register read/write logic implementation (from data-model.md Behavior sections)
- [ ] T014 Device state management and attributes (from data-model.md Device Attributes)
- [ ] T015 Error handling and logging for device operations
- [ ] T016 [P] Incremental build validation using `build_simics_project(project_path="./simics-project", module="DEVICE_NAME")`

## Phase 3.4: Integration
- [ ] T015 Connect UserService to DB
- [ ] T016 Auth middleware
- [ ] T017 Request/response logging
- [ ] T018 CORS and security headers

**Simics Integration Example:**
- [ ] T017 Connect device to memory interface using transact() methods (from data-model.md Interfaces)
- [ ] T018 Implement interrupt line connections and events (from data-model.md External Interfaces)
- [ ] T019 Add external port communications and protocols
- [ ] T020 Integrate with Simics checkpointing and state management (from data-model.md State Transitions)
- [ ] T021 [P] Validate integration with `build_simics_project(project_path="./simics-project")`
- [ ] T022 [P] Run comprehensive tests using `run_simics_test(project_path="./simics-project", suite="modules/DEVICE_NAME/test")`

## Phase 3.5: Polish
- [ ] T019 [P] Unit tests for validation in tests/unit/test_validation.py
- [ ] T020 Performance tests (<200ms)
- [ ] T021 [P] Update docs/api.md
- [ ] T022 Remove duplication
- [ ] T023 Run manual-testing.md

## Dependencies
- Tests (T004-T007) before implementation (T008-T014)
- T008 blocks T009, T015
- T016 blocks T018
- Implementation before polish (T019-T023)
### Simics Dependencies
- Project creation (T001) before device skeleton (T002)
- Device skeleton (T002) before build validation (T003)
- Build validation (T003) before tests (T004-T007)
- Tests (T004-T007) before implementation (T008-T016)
- Device implementation (T008-T016) before integration (T017-T022)
- Integration validation (T021-T022) before polish tasks

**NOTE**: Phase 0 MCP tools (`get_simics_version()`, `list_installed_packages()`, `list_simics_platforms()`, documentation and example tools) already executed during /plan phase - their outputs in research.md inform all subsequent tasks.

## Parallel Example
```
# Launch T004-T007 together:
Task: "Contract test POST /api/users in tests/contract/test_users_post.py"
Task: "Contract test GET /api/users/{id} in tests/contract/test_users_get.py"
Task: "Integration test registration in tests/integration/test_registration.py"
Task: "Integration test auth in tests/integration/test_auth.py"
```

## Notes
- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies
- Verify tests fail before implementing
- Commit after each task
- Avoid: vague tasks, same file conflicts

## Task Generation Rules
*Applied during main() execution*

1. **From Contracts**:
   - Each contract file → contract test task [P]
   - Each endpoint → implementation task
   - **Simics**: Each register interface → register test task [P]
   
2. **From Data Model**:
   - Each entity → model creation task [P]
   - Relationships → service layer tasks
   - **Simics**: Each register group → DML file task [P]
   
3. **From User Stories**:
   - Each story → integration test [P]
   - Quickstart scenarios → validation tasks
   - **Simics**: Each device workflow → operational test [P]

4. **Ordering**:
   - Setup → Tests → Models → Services → Endpoints → Polish
   - **Simics**: MCP Setup → Tests → Registers → Interfaces → Device → Integration → Validation → Polish
   - Dependencies block parallel execution
   - **Simics MCP Tools**: Use at each validation step for continuous integration

## Validation Checklist
*GATE: Checked by main() before returning*

- [ ] All contracts have corresponding tests
- [ ] All entities have model tasks
- [ ] All tests come before implementation
- [ ] Parallel tasks truly independent
- [ ] Each task specifies exact file path
- [ ] No task modifies same file as another [P] task

**Simics-Specific Validation:**
- [ ] All MCP tool calls specify correct project_path
- [ ] Build validation tasks after implementation changes
- [ ] Test execution tasks use appropriate suite parameter
- [ ] Device name consistently used across MCP tool calls
- [ ] Phase 0 MCP tool outputs from research.md correctly referenced in tasks

## Phase 0 Prerequisites (Simics Projects)
**✅ These MCP tools were already executed during /plan Phase 0:**

The following discovery and documentation MCP tools completed in Phase 0 and their outputs are in research.md:
- `get_simics_version()` - Environment discovery
- `list_installed_packages()` - Package validation
- `list_simics_platforms()` - Platform discovery
- `pageindex_rag_query_drm(string)` - DML language reference
- `pageindex_rag_query_model_builder(string)` - Modeling patterns
- `get_simics_dml_template()` - Base device structure
- `get_simics_device_example_i2c()` - Reference implementation patterns
- `get_simics_device_example_ds12887()` - Advanced patterns
- Test patterns extracted from python_test_samples_path

**These outputs informed:**
- data-model.md register and interface definitions
- contracts/ test specifications
- Task generation in this file

**Only implementation MCP tools remain** for Phase 3:
- `create_simics_project()` (T001)
- `add_dml_device_skeleton()` (T002)
- `build_simics_project()` (T003, T011, T016, T021)
- `run_simics_test()` (T007, T022)
