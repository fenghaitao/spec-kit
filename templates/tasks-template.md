# Tasks: [FEATURE NAME]

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/[###-feature-name]/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), research.md, data-model.md, contracts/

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Load plan.md from feature directory
   → If not found: ERROR "No implementation plan found"
   → Extract: tech stack, libraries, structure
2. Load optional design documents:
   → data-model.md: Extract entities → model tasks
   → contracts/: Each file → contract test task
   → research.md: Extract decisions → setup tasks
   → **Simics projects**: Extract register definitions → DML file tasks (after project structure is generated by MCP server)
3. Generate tasks by category:
   → Setup: project init, dependencies, linting
   → Tests: contract tests, integration tests
   → Core: models, services, CLI commands
   → Integration: DB, middleware, logging
   → Polish: unit tests, performance, docs
4. Apply task rules:
   → Different files = mark [P] for parallel
   → Same file = sequential (no [P])
   → Tests before implementation (TDD)
5. Number tasks sequentially (T001, T002...)
6. Generate dependency graph
7. Create parallel execution examples
8. Validate task completeness:
   → All contracts have tests?
   → All entities have models?
   → All endpoints implemented?
9. Return: SUCCESS (tasks ready for execution)
```

## Format: `[ID] [P?] Description`
- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions
- **Single project**: `src/`, `tests/` at repository root
- **Web app**: `backend/src/`, `frontend/src/`
- **Mobile**: `api/src/`, `ios/src/` or `android/src/`
- **Simics**: `./simics-project/modules/device-name/`, `./simics-project/modules/device-name/test/` at repository root
- Paths shown below assume single project - adjust based on plan.md structure

## Phase 3.1: Setup
- [ ] T001 Create project structure per implementation plan
- [ ] T002 Initialize [language] project with [framework] dependencies

- [ ] T002 Create Simics project structure using `create_simics_project(project_path="./simics-project")`
- [ ] T003 Add device skeleton using `add_dml_device_skeleton(project_path="./simics-project", device_name="DEVICE_NAME")`
- [ ] T004 [P] Verify project structure and build system using `build_simics_project(project_path="./simics-project", module="DEVICE_NAME")`
- [ ] T005 **MANDATORY**: Access DML 1.4 reference documentation using `get_simics_dml_1_4_reference_manual()`
- [ ] T006 **MANDATORY**: Access Model Builder User Guide using `get_simics_model_builder_user_guide()`
- [ ] T007 **MANDATORY**: Retrieve DML template using `get_simics_dml_template()` for base device structure patterns

- [ ] T011 **RAG SEARCH**: Use `perform_rag_query("Simics register modeling", source_type="dml", match_count=5)` for register-specific guidance
- [ ] T012 **CRITICAL**: Study and document the retrieved documentation, examples, DML template, and RAG search results before proceeding to test or implementation phases
- [ ] T013 **VALIDATION**: Verify that documentation, examples, and RAG searches have been successfully retrieved and analyzed

## Phase 3.2: Tests First (TDD) ⚠️ MUST COMPLETE BEFORE 3.3
**CRITICAL: These tests MUST be written and MUST FAIL before ANY implementation**
- [ ] T004 [P] Contract test POST /api/users in tests/contract/test_users_post.py

## Parallel Example
```
# Launch T004-T007 together:
Task: "Contract test POST /api/users in tests/contract/test_users_post.py"
Task: "Contract test GET /api/users/{id} in tests/contract/test_users_get.py"
Task: "Integration test registration in tests/integration/test_registration.py"
Task: "Integration test auth in tests/integration/test_auth.py"
```

## Notes
- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies
- Verify tests fail before implementing
- Commit after each task
- Avoid: vague tasks, same file conflicts

## Task Generation Rules
*Applied during main() execution*

1. **From Contracts**:
   - Each contract file → contract test task [P]
   - Each endpoint → implementation task
   - **Simics**: Each register interface → register test task [P]
   
2. **From Data Model**:
   - Each entity → model creation task [P]
   - Relationships → service layer tasks
   - **Simics**: Each register group → DML file task [P]
   
3. **From User Stories**:
   - Each story → integration test [P]
   - Quickstart scenarios → validation tasks
   - **Simics**: Each device workflow → operational test [P]

4. **Ordering**:
   - Setup → Tests → Models → Services → Endpoints → Polish
   - **Simics**: MCP Setup → Tests → Registers → Interfaces → Device → Integration → Validation → Polish
   - Dependencies block parallel execution
   - **Simics MCP Tools**: Use at each validation step for continuous integration

## Validation Checklist
*GATE: Checked by main() before returning*

- [ ] All contracts have corresponding tests
- [ ] All entities have model tasks
- [ ] All tests come before implementation
- [ ] Parallel tasks truly independent
- [ ] Each task specifies exact file path
- [ ] No task modifies same file as another [P] task

**Simics-Specific Validation:**
- [ ] All MCP tool calls specify correct project_path
- [ ] Build validation tasks after implementation changes
- [ ] Test execution tasks use appropriate suite parameter
- [ ] Device name consistently used across MCP tool calls
- [ ] RAG searches use appropriate source_type for each phase
- [ ] RAG search results documented before proceeding to implementation
- [ ] match_count parameter set to 5 for all searches

## Critical MCP Tool Execution Gate
**⚠️ MANDATORY: These MCP tools MUST be executed before proceeding to Phase 3.2 (Tests)**

### Pre-Test Phase Gate Checklist:
- [ ] **GATE T005**: `get_simics_dml_1_4_reference_manual()` has been successfully executed and returned valid documentation paths
- [ ] **GATE T006**: `get_simics_model_builder_user_guide()` has been successfully executed and returned valid guide paths
- [ ] **GATE T007**: `get_simics_dml_template()` has been successfully executed and returned valid DML template code
- [ ] **GATE T008**: `get_simics_device_example_i2c()` has been successfully executed and returned valid I2C device example code
- [ ] **GATE T009**: `get_simics_device_example_ds12887()` has been successfully executed and returned valid DS12887 device example code
- [ ] **GATE T010**: `perform_rag_query()` executed for DML device patterns with valid results
- [ ] **GATE T011**: `perform_rag_query()` executed for Simics register modeling with valid results
- [ ] **GATE T012**: Retrieved documentation, examples, DML template, and RAG search results have been studied and documented for reference during implementation
- [ ] **GATE T013**: Validation confirms that all MCP tools and RAG searches returned non-empty, valid content

### Execution Validation Rules:
1. **Immediate Execution**: When T005-T011 are encountered, the MCP functions and RAG searches MUST be called immediately
2. **Success Verification**: Each MCP call and RAG search must return valid content before marking task complete
3. **Documentation Required**: Results must be saved and documented for later reference
4. **python_test_samples_path Access**: Device examples must include access to test sample paths for TDD phase
5. **RAG Search Parameters**: Use appropriate source_type and match_count=5 for all searches
6. **Blocking Dependency**: No Phase 3.2+ tasks can proceed until ALL setup MCP tools and RAG searches are successfully executed

### Common Execution Failures:
- ❌ **Stating intention without execution**: "Let's call get_simics_device_example_i2c" or "Let's search with RAG" without actually invoking
- ❌ **Skipping to file operations**: Moving to task file updates instead of executing MCP calls and RAG searches
- ❌ **Assuming completion**: Marking tasks complete without verifying MCP tool and RAG execution
- ❌ **Ignoring test samples**: Not accessing python_test_samples_path from device examples
- ❌ **Wrong source_type**: Using source_type="all" when specific type (dml/python/source) would be more appropriate
- ✅ **Correct approach**: Execute MCP function/RAG search → Verify result → Access test samples → Document output → Mark complete
