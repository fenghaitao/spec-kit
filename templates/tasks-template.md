# Tasks: [FEATURE NAME]

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/[###-feature-name]/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), research.md, data-model.md, contracts/

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Load plan.md from feature directory
   → If not found: ERROR "No implementation plan found"
   → Extract: tech stack, libraries, structure
2. Load optional design documents:
   → data-model.md: Extract entities → model tasks
   → contracts/: Each file → contract test task
   → research.md: Extract decisions → setup tasks
   → **Simics projects**: Extract register definitions → DML file tasks (after project structure is generated by MCP server)
3. Generate tasks by category:
   → Setup: project init, dependencies, linting
   → Tests: contract tests, integration tests
   → Core: models, services, CLI commands
   → Integration: DB, middleware, logging
   → Polish: unit tests, performance, docs
4. Apply task rules:
   → Different files = mark [P] for parallel
   → Same file = sequential (no [P])
   → Tests before implementation (TDD)
5. Number tasks sequentially (T001, T002...)
6. Generate dependency graph
7. Create parallel execution examples
8. Validate task completeness:
   → All contracts have tests?
   → All entities have models?
   → All endpoints implemented?
9. Return: SUCCESS (tasks ready for execution)
```

## Format: `[ID] [P?] Description`
- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions
- **Single project**: `src/`, `tests/` at repository root
- **Web app**: `backend/src/`, `frontend/src/`
- **Mobile**: `api/src/`, `ios/src/` or `android/src/`
- **Simics**: `modules/device-name/`, `modules/device-name/test/` at repository root
- Paths shown below assume single project - adjust based on plan.md structure

## Phase 3.1: Setup
- [ ] T001 Create project structure per implementation plan
- [ ] T002 Initialize [language] project with [framework] dependencies
- [ ] T003 [P] Configure linting and formatting tools

**Simics Setup Example:**
- [ ] T001 Verify simics-mcp-server connection and Simics installation using `get_simics_version()`
- [ ] T002 Create Simics project structure using `create_simics_project(project_path="simics-project")`
- [ ] T003 Add device skeleton using `add_dml_device_skeleton(project_path="simics-project", device_name="DEVICE_NAME")`
- [ ] T004 [P] Verify project structure and build system using `build_simics_project(project_path="simics-project", module="DEVICE_NAME")`
- [ ] T005 **MANDATORY**: Execute `get_simics_device_example()` to retrieve DML example code and patterns
- [ ] T006 **MANDATORY**: Execute `get_dml_template()` to retrieve DML template structures and syntax
- [ ] T007 **CRITICAL**: Study and document the retrieved examples before proceeding to test or implementation phases
- [ ] T008 **VALIDATION**: Verify that example code and templates have been successfully retrieved and analyzed

## Phase 3.2: Tests First (TDD) ⚠️ MUST COMPLETE BEFORE 3.3
**CRITICAL: These tests MUST be written and MUST FAIL before ANY implementation**
- [ ] T004 [P] Contract test POST /api/users in tests/contract/test_users_post.py
- [ ] T005 [P] Contract test GET /api/users/{id} in tests/contract/test_users_get.py
- [ ] T006 [P] Integration test user registration in tests/integration/test_registration.py
- [ ] T007 [P] Integration test auth flow in tests/integration/test_auth.py

**Simics TDD Example:**
- [ ] T009 [P] Register access test in modules/device-name/test/s-registers.py
- [ ] T010 [P] Interface behavior test in modules/device-name/test/s-interfaces.py
- [ ] T011 [P] Device workflow test in modules/device-name/test/s-device-name.py (main test file)
- [ ] T012 [P] Set up and validate test environment using `run_simics_test(project_path="simics-project", suite="modules/DEVICE_NAME/test")`

## Phase 3.3: Core Implementation (ONLY after tests are failing)
- [ ] T008 [P] User model in src/models/user.py
- [ ] T009 [P] UserService CRUD in src/services/user_service.py
- [ ] T010 [P] CLI --create-user in src/cli/user_commands.py
- [ ] T011 POST /api/users endpoint
- [ ] T012 GET /api/users/{id} endpoint
- [ ] T013 Input validation
- [ ] T014 Error handling and logging

**Simics Implementation Example:**
- [ ] T013 [P] Register definitions in modules/device-name/registers.dml
- [ ] T014 [P] Interface declarations in modules/device-name/interfaces.dml
- [ ] T015 [P] Utility methods in modules/device-name/utility.dml
- [ ] T016 [P] Build device module using `build_simics_project(project_path="simics-project", module="DEVICE_NAME")`
- [ ] T017 Main device structure in modules/device-name/device-name.dml
- [ ] T018 Register read/write logic implementation
- [ ] T019 Device state management and attributes
- [ ] T020 Error handling and logging for device operations
- [ ] T021 [P] Incremental build validation using `build_simics_project(project_path="simics-project", module="DEVICE_NAME")`

## Phase 3.4: Integration
- [ ] T015 Connect UserService to DB
- [ ] T016 Auth middleware
- [ ] T017 Request/response logging
- [ ] T018 CORS and security headers

**Simics Integration Example:**
- [ ] T022 Connect device to memory interface using transact() methods
- [ ] T023 Implement interrupt line connections and events
- [ ] T024 Add external port communications and protocols
- [ ] T025 Integrate with Simics checkpointing and state management
- [ ] T026 [P] Validate integration with `build_simics_project(project_path="simics-project")`
- [ ] T027 [P] Run comprehensive tests using `run_simics_test(project_path="simics-project", suite="modules/DEVICE_NAME/test")`

## Phase 3.5: Polish
- [ ] T019 [P] Unit tests for validation in tests/unit/test_validation.py
- [ ] T020 Performance tests (<200ms)
- [ ] T021 [P] Update docs/api.md
- [ ] T022 Remove duplication
- [ ] T023 Run manual-testing.md

## Dependencies

- T008 blocks T009, T015
- T016 blocks T018
- Implementation before polish (T019-T023)
### Simics Dependencies

- Project structure (T002) before device skeleton (T003)
- Device skeleton (T003) before build validation (T004)
- Build validation (T004) before MCP tool execution (T005-T006)
- MCP tool execution (T005-T006) before documentation (T007)
- Documentation study (T007) before validation (T008)
- Validation (T008) before register tests (T009-T012)
- Register tests (T009-T012) before implementation (T013-T021)
- Device implementation (T013-T021) before integration (T022-T027)
- Integration validation (T026-T027) before polish tasks

## Parallel Example
```
# Launch T004-T007 together:
Task: "Contract test POST /api/users in tests/contract/test_users_post.py"
Task: "Contract test GET /api/users/{id} in tests/contract/test_users_get.py"
Task: "Integration test registration in tests/integration/test_registration.py"
Task: "Integration test auth in tests/integration/test_auth.py"
```

## Notes
- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies
- Verify tests fail before implementing
- Commit after each task
- Avoid: vague tasks, same file conflicts

## Task Generation Rules
*Applied during main() execution*

1. **From Contracts**:
   - Each contract file → contract test task [P]
   - Each endpoint → implementation task
   - **Simics**: Each register interface → register test task [P]
   
2. **From Data Model**:
   - Each entity → model creation task [P]
   - Relationships → service layer tasks
   - **Simics**: Each register group → DML file task [P]
   
3. **From User Stories**:
   - Each story → integration test [P]
   - Quickstart scenarios → validation tasks
   - **Simics**: Each device workflow → operational test [P]

4. **Ordering**:
   - Setup → Tests → Models → Services → Endpoints → Polish
   - **Simics**: MCP Setup → Tests → Registers → Interfaces → Device → Integration → Validation → Polish
   - Dependencies block parallel execution
   - **Simics MCP Tools**: Use at each validation step for continuous integration

## Validation Checklist
*GATE: Checked by main() before returning*

- [ ] All contracts have corresponding tests
- [ ] All entities have model tasks
- [ ] All tests come before implementation
- [ ] Parallel tasks truly independent
- [ ] Each task specifies exact file path
- [ ] No task modifies same file as another [P] task

**Simics-Specific Validation:**
- [ ] All MCP tool calls specify correct project_path
- [ ] Build validation tasks after implementation changes
- [ ] Test execution tasks use appropriate suite parameter
- [ ] Device name consistently used across MCP tool calls

## Critical MCP Tool Execution Gate
**⚠️ MANDATORY: These MCP tools MUST be executed before proceeding to Phase 3.2 (Tests)**

### Pre-Test Phase Gate Checklist:
- [ ] **GATE T005**: `get_simics_device_example()` has been successfully executed and returned valid DML example code
- [ ] **GATE T006**: `get_dml_template()` has been successfully executed and returned valid DML template structures
- [ ] **GATE T007**: Retrieved examples have been studied and documented for reference during implementation
- [ ] **GATE T008**: Validation confirms that both MCP tools returned non-empty, valid content

### Execution Validation Rules:
1. **Immediate Execution**: When T005 or T006 is encountered, the MCP function MUST be called immediately
2. **Success Verification**: Each MCP call must return valid content before marking task complete
3. **Documentation Required**: Results must be saved and documented for later reference
4. **Blocking Dependency**: No Phase 3.2+ tasks can proceed until ALL setup MCP tools are successfully executed

### Common Execution Failures:
- ❌ **Stating intention without execution**: "Let's call get_simics_device_example" without actually invoking it
- ❌ **Skipping to file operations**: Moving to task file updates instead of executing MCP calls
- ❌ **Assuming completion**: Marking tasks complete without verifying MCP tool execution
- ✅ **Correct approach**: Execute MCP function → Verify result → Document output → Mark complete
