# Tasks: [FEATURE NAME]

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/[###-feature-name]/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), research.md, data-model.md, contracts/

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Load plan.md from feature directory
   → If not found: ERROR "No implementation plan found"
   → Extract: tech stack, libraries, structure
2. Load optional design documents:
   → data-model.md: Extract entities → model tasks
   → contracts/: Each file → contract test task
   → research.md: Extract decisions → setup tasks
   → **Simics projects**: Extract register definitions → DML file tasks (after project structure is generated by MCP server)
3. Generate tasks by category:
   → Setup: project init, dependencies, linting
   → Tests: contract tests, integration tests
   → Core: models, services, CLI commands
   → Integration: DB, middleware, logging
   → Polish: unit tests, performance, docs
4. Apply task rules:
   → Different files = mark [P] for parallel
   → Same file = sequential (no [P])
   → Tests before implementation (TDD)
5. Number tasks sequentially (T001, T002...)
6. Generate dependency graph
7. Create parallel execution examples
8. Validate task completeness:
   → All contracts have tests?
   → All entities have models?
   → All endpoints implemented?
9. Return: SUCCESS (tasks ready for execution)
```

## Format: `[ID] [P?] Description`
- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions
- **Single project**: `src/`, `tests/` at repository root
- **Web app**: `backend/src/`, `frontend/src/`
- **Mobile**: `api/src/`, `ios/src/` or `android/src/`
- **Simics**: `./simics-project/modules/device-name/`, `./simics-project/modules/device-name/test/` at repository root
- Paths shown below assume single project - adjust based on plan.md structure

## Phase 3.1: Setup
- [ ] T001 Create project structure per implementation plan
- [ ] T002 Initialize [language] project with [framework] dependencies
- [ ] T003 [P] Configure linting and formatting tools

**Simics Setup Example:**
- [ ] T001 Create Simics project structure using `create_simics_project(project_path="./simics-project")`
- [ ] T002 Add device skeleton using `add_dml_device_skeleton(project_path="./simics-project", device_name="DEVICE_NAME")`
- [ ] T003 [P] Verify project structure and build system using `build_simics_project(project_path="./simics-project", module="DEVICE_NAME")`

**NOTE**: Discovery and documentation MCP tools (`get_simics_version()`, `list_installed_packages()`, `list_simics_platforms()`, `pageindex_rag_query_drm(string)`, ``pageindex_rag_query_model_builder(string)`, `get_simics_dml_template()`, `get_simics_device_example_i2c()`, `get_simics_device_example_ds12887()`) were already executed during Phase 0 of /plan command. Their outputs are documented in research.md and informed the design in data-model.md and contracts/.

## Phase 3.2: Tests First (TDD) ⚠️ MUST COMPLETE BEFORE 3.3
**CRITICAL: These tests MUST be written and MUST FAIL before ANY implementation**
- [ ] T004 [P] Contract test POST /api/users in tests/contract/test_users_post.py
- [ ] T005 [P] Contract test GET /api/users/{id} in tests/contract/test_users_get.py
- [ ] T006 [P] Integration test user registration in tests/integration/test_registration.py
- [ ] T007 [P] Integration test auth flow in tests/integration/test_auth.py

**Simics TDD Example:**
- [ ] T004 [P] Register access test in simics-project/modules/device-name/test/s-registers.py (using test patterns from research.md python_test_samples_path analysis)
- [ ] T005 [P] Interface behavior test in simics-project/modules/device-name/test/s-interfaces.py
- [ ] T006 [P] Device workflow test in simics-project/modules/device-name/test/s-device-name.py (main test file)
- [ ] T007 [P] Validate tests fail as expected using `run_simics_test(project_path="./simics-project", suite="modules/DEVICE_NAME/test")`

## Phase 3.3: Core Implementation (ONLY after tests are failing)
- [ ] T008 [P] User model in src/models/user.py
- [ ] T009 [P] UserService CRUD in src/services/user_service.py
- [ ] T010 [P] CLI --create-user in src/cli/user_commands.py
- [ ] T011 POST /api/users endpoint
- [ ] T012 GET /api/users/{id} endpoint
- [ ] T013 Input validation
- [ ] T014 Error handling and logging

**Simics Implementation Example:**

**CRITICAL PRINCIPLES** (Apply to all Simics tasks below):
- Focus on **software-visible behaviors** - Simics is a functional simulator
- Omit low-level internal hardware logic irrelevant to software
- Device need not be 100% identical to physical device
- Internal parts invisible to software can be simplified
- **MANDATORY**: All `register`s MUST be 100% correct (visible to software/outside world)
- Hardware-layer protocols NOT needed - this is software emulation
- Memory read/write MUST use Simics `transact()` method
- DO NOT use your own knowledge - refer to MCP tool information
- Remind yourself of Simics concepts and DML syntax before each task

**Implementation Tasks:**
- [ ] T008 [P] Define ALL registers in simics-project/modules/device-name/device-name.dml
      * Declare all `register`s, `port`s, `connect`s from data-model.md
      * Reference original spec in comments for each register
      * Leave side effects unimplemented (use `unimpl`) with clear comments
      * Separate register declarations from logic
      * List unclear/questionable spec parts in top comment
      * Use pageindex_rag_query_drm for DML syntax validation
- [ ] T009 [P] Implement register-specific logic (read/write methods)
      * Implement `write_register()` and `read_register()` methods (or `read()`/`write()`)
      * Add spec references in comments for each implementation
      * Use `attribute`s for internal state, runtime config, checkpointing
      * DO NOT use magic numbers in return values
      * Keep side effects in methods, not inline
- [ ] T010 [P] Add interface declarations in device-name.dml
      * Implement `interface`s in `connect` for device communication
      * Memory interfaces using `transact()`
      * Interrupt lines, links, and external connections
      * Use `template`s from "utility.dml" to minimize redundancy
      * Reference data-model.md Interfaces section
- [ ] T011 [P] Build and validate register structure using `build_simics_project(project_path="./simics-project", module="DEVICE_NAME")`
      * Fix syntax errors from build output
      * Iterate until clean build
- [ ] T012 Implement remaining functionality and side effects
      * Complete all clearly stated side effects from spec
      * Trigger external methods for complex actions (not inline)
      * Leave unclear logic as `TODO` with comments at top of file
      * Reference original spec text in all implementation comments
- [ ] T013 Add event handling for asynchronous operations
      * Define `event`s for deferred operations (polling, etc.)
      * No events needed for immediate reactions
      * Ensure state management for checkpointing/restoration
- [ ] T014 Implement device workflows and state transitions
      * From data-model.md Device State and State Transitions
      * Use common `method`s for reusable code
      * Simplify internal behavior as long as external state is correct
      * Example: Counter doesn't need actual ticking - just expected state and interrupt
- [ ] T015 Error handling and unimplemented features
      * Mark all unimplemented parts with `TODO` in top file comment
      * DO NOT implement unclear or conflicting spec parts
      * Add logging for device operations
- [ ] T016 [P] Final build validation using `build_simics_project(project_path="./simics-project", module="DEVICE_NAME")`
      * Verify all registers implemented
      * Confirm no syntax errors
      * Validate against spec completeness

## Phase 3.4: Integration
- [ ] T015 Connect UserService to DB
- [ ] T016 Auth middleware
- [ ] T017 Request/response logging
- [ ] T018 CORS and security headers

**Simics Integration Example:**
- [ ] T017 Connect device to memory interface using transact() methods (from data-model.md Interfaces)
- [ ] T018 Implement interrupt line connections and events (from data-model.md External Interfaces)
- [ ] T019 Add external port communications and protocols
- [ ] T020 Integrate with Simics checkpointing and state management (from data-model.md State Transitions)
- [ ] T021 [P] Validate integration with `build_simics_project(project_path="./simics-project")`
- [ ] T022 [P] Run comprehensive tests using `run_simics_test(project_path="./simics-project", suite="modules/DEVICE_NAME/test")`

## Phase 3.5: Polish
- [ ] T019 [P] Unit tests for validation in tests/unit/test_validation.py
- [ ] T020 Performance tests (<200ms)
- [ ] T021 [P] Update docs/api.md
- [ ] T022 Remove duplication
- [ ] T023 Run manual-testing.md

## Dependencies
- Tests (T004-T007) before implementation (T008-T014)
- T008 blocks T009, T015
- T016 blocks T018
- Implementation before polish (T019-T023)
### Simics Dependencies
- Project creation (T001) before device skeleton (T002)
- Device skeleton (T002) before build validation (T003)
- Build validation (T003) before tests (T004-T007)
- Tests (T004-T007) before implementation (T008-T016)
- Device implementation (T008-T016) before integration (T017-T022)
- Integration validation (T021-T022) before polish tasks

**NOTE**: Phase 0 MCP tools (`get_simics_version()`, `list_installed_packages()`, `list_simics_platforms()`, documentation and example tools) already executed during /plan phase - their outputs in research.md inform all subsequent tasks.

## Parallel Example
```
# Launch T004-T007 together:
Task: "Contract test POST /api/users in tests/contract/test_users_post.py"
Task: "Contract test GET /api/users/{id} in tests/contract/test_users_get.py"
Task: "Integration test registration in tests/integration/test_registration.py"
Task: "Integration test auth in tests/integration/test_auth.py"
```

## Notes
- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies
- Verify tests fail before implementing
- Commit after each task
- Avoid: vague tasks, same file conflicts

## Task Generation Rules
*Applied during main() execution*

1. **From Contracts**:
   - Each contract file → contract test task [P]
   - Each endpoint → implementation task
   - **Simics**: Each register interface → register test task [P]
   
2. **From Data Model**:
   - Each entity → model creation task [P]
   - Relationships → service layer tasks
   - **Simics**: Each register group → DML file task [P]
   
3. **From User Stories**:
   - Each story → integration test [P]
   - Quickstart scenarios → validation tasks
   - **Simics**: Each device workflow → operational test [P]

4. **Ordering**:
   - Setup → Tests → Models → Services → Endpoints → Polish
   - **Simics**: MCP Setup → Tests → Registers → Interfaces → Device → Integration → Validation → Polish
   - Dependencies block parallel execution
   - **Simics MCP Tools**: Use at each validation step for continuous integration

## Validation Checklist
*GATE: Checked by main() before returning*

- [ ] All contracts have corresponding tests
- [ ] All entities have model tasks
- [ ] All tests come before implementation
- [ ] Parallel tasks truly independent
- [ ] Each task specifies exact file path
- [ ] No task modifies same file as another [P] task

**Simics-Specific Validation:**
- [ ] All MCP tool calls specify correct project_path
- [ ] Build validation tasks after implementation changes
- [ ] Test execution tasks use appropriate suite parameter
- [ ] Device name consistently used across MCP tool calls
- [ ] Phase 0 MCP tool outputs from research.md correctly referenced in tasks

## Phase 0 Prerequisites (Simics Projects)
