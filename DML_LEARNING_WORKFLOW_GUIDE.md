## File Modifications

### 1. spec-kit/templates/spec-template.md
**Changes**:
- Added "Simics DML Device Modeling Guidance" section
- Enhanced "Hardware Specification" with behavioral focus
- Clarified Step 7: NEEDS CLARIFICATION checkbox is OBJECTIVE

**Purpose**: Inform LLM about DML resources without triggering premature study

**Impact**: Clearer phase separation, reduced confusion

### 2. spec-kit/templates/plan-template.md
**Changes**:
- Initially expanded to ~150 lines with comprehensive DML section
- **User Feedback**: "Too verbose, will exceed context window limit"
- **Reverted**: Back to minimal ~15-line acknowledgment
- **Current State**: Lists documents with paths, defers study to tasks phase

**Purpose**: Token efficiency while maintaining awareness

**Impact**: Saved ~135 lines × every /plan execution

### 3. spec-kit/templates/tasks-template.md (Most Extensively Modified)
**Original**: 531 lines  
**Optimized**: 204 lines  
**Reduction**: 62% (327 lines / ~10KB saved)

**Major Changes**:

**A. Task Repositioning** (Phase Change):
- **Before**: T013-T014 (DML learning) in Phase 3.2 (before tests)
- **After**: T017-T018 (DML learning) in Phase 3.3 (before implementation)
- **Rationale**: Tests use simple patterns from research.md; DML implementation needs deep study
- **Benefit**: Just-in-time learning, shorter context during test phase

**B. Error Recovery Enhancement** (3 → 5 steps):
```markdown
Before (Simple):
1. Check research.md
2. Query RAG
3. Fix and document

After (Comprehensive):
1. Check Grammar Notes (syntax/semantic/template errors)
2. Check Best Practices Notes (patterns/anti-patterns)
3. Check research.md RAG results (from /plan phase)
4. Read Source Documents directly (DML_grammar.md or Best_Practices.md)
5. RAG Query (last resort, document results)

+ Concrete examples with step-by-step resolution
+ Visual workflow diagram
+ Error categorization
```

**C. MCP Absolute Path Requirement**:
- Added critical warning section explaining WHY and HOW
- Updated all 9 MCP tool call examples:
  * `create_simics_project(project_path="/absolute/path/...")`
  * `build_simics_project(project_path="/absolute/path/...")`
  * `run_simics_test(project_path="/absolute/path/...")`
- Added validation checkpoint
- Added execution rule #6
- Added common failure entry

**D. Optimization Details**:
| Section | Before | After | Reduction |
|---------|--------|-------|-----------|
| Error Recovery | 230 lines | 65 lines | 72% |
| Execution Flow | 50 lines | 18 lines | 64% |
| Setup Phase | 23 lines | 10 lines | 57% |
| Dependencies | 26 lines | 8 lines | 69% |
| Gates/Rules | 60 lines | 18 lines | 70% |
| **Total** | **531** | **204** | **62%** |

### 4. spec-kit/templates/tasks-template.md.backup
**Purpose**: Preserve original 531-line version for rollback if needed  
**Status**: Created during optimization

### 5. simics-mcp-server/simics_mcp_server.py
**Fix**: Changed import to use synchronous wrapper functions
```python
from copilot_client import (
    create_embeddings_batch_copilot,
    create_embedding_copilot
)
```

### 6. contributing/samples/spec_kit_integration/start_mcp_servers.sh
**Changes**:
- Updated to start Simics MCP Server on port 8051 (SSE transport)

## Technical Enhancements

### 1. DML Learning Workflow

**Problem**: LLMs lack deep understanding of Simics DML language, leading to:
- Syntax errors in generated DML code
- Violations of DML best practices
- Multiple iteration cycles

**Solution**: Structured 3-phase progressive learning

**Phase 1: /specify** - Hardware Behavior Only
- Focus: WHAT the device does
- DML Knowledge: None (avoids DML syntax)
- Output: Hardware behavior specification

**Phase 2: /plan** - Architecture & Research
- Focus: HOW to structure implementation
- DML Knowledge: High-level patterns from RAG queries
- Output: Architecture plan with research.md

**Phase 3: /tasks** - Deep Learning & Implementation
- Focus: Detailed DML learning → Writing code
- DML Knowledge: Complete (from studying documents)
- Tasks: T017-T018 (mandatory learning) → T019+ (implementation)

**Learning Documents**:
1. `.specify/memory/DML_grammar.md` (100+ pages) - Complete DML 1.4 language specification
2. `.specify/memory/DML_Device_Development_Best_Practices.md` (50+ pages) - Practical patterns and pitfalls

**Expected Outcome in research.md**:
```markdown
## DML Best Practices Study Notes
### Coding Patterns
- Register implementation patterns with examples
- State management approaches
- Interface implementation patterns

### Common Pitfalls
- Mistakes to avoid with explanations
- Performance anti-patterns
- Memory management issues

### Debugging Approaches
- DML compilation error debugging
- Runtime debugging strategies
- Testing approaches

## DML Grammar Study Notes
### Declaration Syntax
- Object/register/bank/attribute declarations
- Field declarations with bit ranges

### Method Syntax
- Method definitions with examples
- Override patterns
- Template methods

### Attribute Usage
- Saved attributes (checkpointing)
- Session attributes (transient state)

### Template System
- Using built-in templates
- Template inheritance
```

### 2. Error Recovery Enhancement

**Before** (3 simple steps):
1. Check research.md
2. Query RAG
3. Fix and document

**After** (5 comprehensive steps):
1. **Check Grammar Notes** → Syntax/semantic/template errors
2. **Check Best Practices Notes** → Patterns/anti-patterns
3. **Check research.md RAG results** → From /plan phase
4. **Read Source Documents** → Direct access to DML_grammar.md or Best_Practices.md
5. **RAG Query** → Last resort, document results

**Error Type Mapping**:
- **Syntax errors** → Grammar notes (register declaration syntax)
- **Semantic errors** → Grammar notes (scoping/types)
- **Pattern errors** → Best Practices notes (io_memory interface)
- **State errors** → Best Practices notes (checkpointing anti-patterns)

**Concrete Examples**:
```
Error: "syntax error near 'register'"
→ Step 1: Check grammar notes for register declaration syntax
→ Find: "register name size N @ offset is (templates) { fields }"
→ Solution: Add size specification

Error: "checkpoint restore fails"
→ Step 2: Check best practices for state management
→ Find: Use saved attributes, not session
→ Solution: Change "session uint32" to "saved uint32"
```

### 3. SSE Transport Absolute Path Requirement

**Problem**: 
- SSE transport MCP servers run in separate process
- Different working directory than client
- Relative paths like `"./simics-project"` resolve to SERVER's directory
- Result: "path not found" errors

**Solution**: Enforce absolute paths for all MCP tool calls

**Before** (Broken):
```python
create_simics_project(project_path="./simics-project")
build_simics_project(project_path="./simics-project", module="timer")
```

**After** (Works):
```python
import os
workspace_root = os.getcwd()
project_path = os.path.join(workspace_root, "simics-project")

create_simics_project(project_path=project_path)
build_simics_project(project_path=project_path, module="timer")
```

**Template Updates** (9 locations):
- Critical warning at top explaining WHY and HOW
- All MCP tool examples show absolute path syntax with ⚠️ marker
- Validation checkpoint
- Execution rule #6
- Common failure entry

---

## Decision Rationale

### Why Move DML Learning from Phase 3.2 to Phase 3.3?

**Context Window Efficiency**:
- Study notes (~20-30KB) would stay in context through all remaining tasks
- Tests don't need deep DML knowledge
- Wastes tokens on information not immediately needed

**Just-in-Time Learning**:
- Learn DML syntax RIGHT before writing DML code
- Natural progression: observe (RAG) → test → learn → implement
- Knowledge fresh in working memory

**Appropriate Complexity**:
- Tests are simpler: Python API + Simics functions
- DML is complex: language syntax, semantic rules, templates
- Don't over-prepare for simple tasks

**RAG Sufficiency for Tests**:
- research.md from /plan already has test patterns
- Python test examples extracted from RAG queries
- No deep DML knowledge needed for "read register, expect value"

### Why Aggressive Optimization?

**User Feedback**: "tasks-template.md is too long, to avoid exceed token limit please refine and simplify it, WITHOUT performance loss"

**Approach**: Consolidate, compress, move details to reference docs

**Result**: 531 → 204 lines (62% reduction) with 100% functionality preserved

**Strategy**:
- Remove redundant explanations
- Compress verbose examples
- Move step-by-step walkthroughs to guide docs
- Multi-line → single lines
- Full paragraphs → bullet points

### Why Keep DML_LEARNING_WORKFLOW_GUIDE.md?

**Size**: 29KB (largest generated doc)

**Content**: 
- Complete phase-by-phase breakdown
- Full workflow example (watchdog timer)
- Benefits, validation, troubleshooting
- Complements templates with comprehensive guidance

**Value**: Permanent reference for developers

**Decision**: Keep as permanent reference documentation
