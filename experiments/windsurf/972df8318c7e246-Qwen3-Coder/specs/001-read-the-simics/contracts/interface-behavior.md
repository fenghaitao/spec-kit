# Interface Behavior Contracts: Watchdog Timer Device

## Overview
This document specifies the expected behavior of all interfaces for the watchdog timer device. These contracts define the functional requirements for signal interactions and timing behavior.

## Signal Interfaces

### Interrupt Signal (wdogint)
**Interface**: interrupt_signal
**Expected Behavior**:
- Asserted when timer reaches zero and INTEN=1 and no previous interrupt pending
- Deasserted immediately after assertion (pulse)
- Not asserted if INTEN=0
- Not asserted if previous interrupt is still pending
- In integration test mode, reflects WDOGITOP[1] value

### Reset Signal (wdogres)
**Interface**: reset_signal
**Expected Behavior**:
- Asserted when timer reaches zero and RESEN=1 and previous interrupt is pending
- Remains asserted until system reset occurs
- Not asserted if RESEN=0
- Not asserted on first timeout (only second timeout)
- In integration test mode, reflects WDOGITOP[0] value

## Clock Interface
**Interface**: clock input
**Expected Behavior**:
- Timer decrements on each clock cycle (adjusted by step_value divider)
- When step_value=000 (÷1): Decrement every clock cycle
- When step_value=001 (÷2): Decrement every 2 clock cycles
- When step_value=010 (÷4): Decrement every 4 clock cycles
- When step_value=011 (÷8): Decrement every 8 clock cycles
- When step_value=100 (÷16): Decrement every 16 clock cycles

## Reset Input Interface
**Interface**: reset_input
**Expected Behavior**:
- When asserted, all device state resets to initial values
- WDOGLOAD and WDOGVALUE set to 0xFFFFFFFF
- WDOGCONTROL set to 0x00000000
- WDOGLOCK set to 0x00000000 (unlocked)
- All pending interrupts cleared
- Timer operation stops until reset deasserted

## Integration Test Interfaces

### Test Mode Control
**Interface**: WDOGITCR register access
**Expected Behavior**:
- When WDOGITCR[0]=1: Enable integration test mode
- When WDOGITCR[0]=0: Disable integration test mode
- Enabling test mode suspends normal timer operation
- Disabling test mode resumes normal timer operation

### Test Output Control
**Interface**: WDOGITOP register write
**Expected Behavior**:
- Only effective when integration test mode is enabled
- WDOGITOP[1] directly controls interrupt output value
- WDOGITOP[0] directly controls reset output value
- Changes to WDOGITOP immediately reflected on output signals

## Timing Contracts

### Timeout Detection
**Condition**: Timer counting with INTEN=1
**Expected Behavior**:
- When timer reaches zero:
  * If no previous interrupt pending: Assert interrupt signal
  * If previous interrupt pending: Assert reset signal (if RESEN=1)
- Timer reloads from WDOGLOAD value after timeout
- Timeout detection occurs within one clock cycle of timer reaching zero

### Signal Assertion Duration
**Condition**: Interrupt or reset signal assertion
**Expected Behavior**:
- Interrupt signal: Asserted for one clock cycle (pulse)
- Reset signal: Asserted until system reset occurs
- Signal transitions occur synchronously with clock

### Lock Protection Timing
**Condition**: Register access when locked
**Expected Behavior**:
- Lock status checked before register write operation
- Locked register writes complete within one clock cycle
- No observable side effects from locked register writes

## Error Handling

### Invalid Signal States
**Condition**: Unexpected signal transitions
**Expected Behavior**:
- Device maintains stable operation
- No corruption of internal state
- Log message generated for debugging
- Device continues to function normally

### Clock Glitches
**Condition**: Irregular clock signal
**Expected Behavior**:
- Device filters out clock glitches shorter than one cycle
- Timer only decrements on valid clock edges
- No false timeouts due to clock noise

## State Transitions

### Normal Operation to Test Mode
**Transition**: WDOGITCR[0] 0→1
**Expected Behavior**:
- Timer operation suspends immediately
- Output signals reflect WDOGITOP values
- Internal state preserved
- Register access behavior unchanged

### Test Mode to Normal Operation
**Transition**: WDOGITCR[0] 1→0
**Expected Behavior**:
- Timer operation resumes with current WDOGLOAD value
- Output signals controlled by timer operation
- Integration test values cleared
- Normal register protection restored

### Lock State Transitions
**Transition**: WDOGLOCK write
**Expected Behavior**:
- Writing 0x1ACCE551: All registers unlocked immediately
- Writing other value: All registers locked immediately
- No effect on WDOGLOCK register itself
- No effect on identification registers
- Transition completes within one register write cycle
