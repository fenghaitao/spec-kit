# Implementation Plan: [FEATURE]

**Branch**: `[###-feature-name]` | **Date**: [DATE] | **Spec**: [link]
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/[###-feature-name]/spec.md`

## Execution Flow (/plan command scope)
```
1. Load feature spec from Input path
   → If not found: ERROR "No feature spec at {path}"
2. Fill Technical Context (scan for NEEDS CLARIFICATION)
   → Detect Project Type from context (web=frontend+backend, mobile=app+api, simics=hardware device)
   → Set Structure Decision based on project type
3. Fill the Constitution Check section based on the content of the constitution document.
4. Evaluate Constitution Check section below
   → If violations exist: Document in Complexity Tracking
   → If no justification possible: ERROR "Simplify approach first"
   → Update Progress Tracking: Initial Constitution Check
5. Execute Phase 0 → research.md
   → If NEEDS CLARIFICATION remain: ERROR "Resolve unknowns"
6. Execute Phase 1 → contracts, data-model.md, quickstart.md, agent-specific template file (e.g., `CLAUDE.md` for Claude Code, `.github/copilot-instructions.md` for GitHub Copilot, `GEMINI.md` for Gemini CLI, `QWEN.md` for Qwen Code, `ADK.md` for adk, or `AGENTS.md` for opencode).
7. Re-evaluate Constitution Check section
   → If new violations: Refactor design, return to Phase 1
   → Update Progress Tracking: Post-Design Constitution Check
8. Plan Phase 2 → Describe task generation approach (DO NOT create tasks.md)
9. STOP - Ready for /tasks command
```

**IMPORTANT**: The /plan command STOPS at step 7. Phases 2-4 are executed by other commands:
- Phase 2: /tasks command creates tasks.md
- Phase 3-4: Implementation execution (manual or via tools)

## Summary
This implementation plan outlines the development of a comprehensive Simics watchdog timer device model compatible with ARM PrimeCell specification. The device will implement a 32-bit countdown timer with configurable timeout periods, interrupt generation on first timeout, and system reset on second timeout. The implementation will include all 21 required registers, lock protection mechanism, and integration test mode support. The device will be mapped to the QSP-x86 platform memory space at address 0x1000 and will connect to platform interrupt and reset controllers.

## Technical Context
**Language/Version**: DML 1.4
**Primary Dependencies**: Simics API, utility.dml
**Storage**: N/A
**Testing**: Simics test scripts
**Target Platform**: Simics 7.x
**Project Type**: simics
**Performance Goals**: Functional accuracy with minimal simulation overhead
**Constraints**: Software-visible behavior must match specification exactly, device state persistence for checkpoint/restore
**Scale/Scope**: 21 register device with interrupt and reset generation capabilities

**Simics-Specific Context** (if Project Type = simics):
**Simics Version**: Simics Base 7.57.0
**Required Packages**: simics-base
**Available Platforms**: QSP-x86 platform
**MCP Server**: simics-mcp-server integration available with 22+ tools for project automation, device modeling and documentation access
**Device Type**: Timer device with interrupt and reset generation capabilities
**Hardware Interfaces**: Memory-mapped registers, interrupt output signal, reset output signal

## Constitution Check
*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

Based on the Simics Model Development Constitution, this project will adhere to the following principles:

1. **Device-First Development**: The watchdog timer will be implemented as a standalone device model with clear hardware abstraction boundaries.
2. **Interface-First Architecture**: All device components will communicate through well-defined hardware interfaces, with memory-mapped registers and signal connections specified before logic implementation.
3. **Test-First Development**: TDD will be followed with specification tests written before implementation, ensuring behavior verification before implementation complexity.
4. **Specification-Driven Implementation**: All implementation decisions will be based strictly on the provided hardware specifications from simics-wdt-spec.md and wdt.md.
5. **Observability and Transparency**: Device states will be inspectable at runtime, with comprehensive logging of device operations.
6. **Simplicity and Incremental Development**: The implementation will start simple, modeling only software-visible behaviors initially, with internal complexity added only when required for accuracy.

**Post-Design Constitution Check**: PASS

The design artifacts created in Phase 1 fully comply with constitutional principles:
- **Device-First Development**: The data model defines a standalone watchdog timer device with clear register and state definitions
- **Interface-First Architecture**: The contracts specify all register access behaviors and interface behaviors before implementation
- **Test-First Development**: The quickstart guide defines validation steps that will drive test creation before implementation
- **Specification-Driven Implementation**: All design decisions are based on the hardware specifications
- **Observability and Transparency**: The data model includes checkpointed state variables for runtime inspection
- **Simplicity and Incremental Development**: The design focuses on software-visible behaviors with clear separation of concerns

**Structure Decision**: [Document the selected structure and reference the real
directories captured above]

**For Simics projects**: The structure above shows the template that will be generated AT REPOSITORY ROOT (not in specs/ folder). The actual project structure will be created by the simics-mcp-server's MCP tools during task execution (Phase 3.1 Setup):
- `create_simics_project(project_path="./simics-project")` creates the base project structure at repo root
- `add_dml_device_skeleton(project_path="./simics-project", device_name=DEVICE_NAME)` adds device-specific modeling files

**IMPORTANT**: Simics projects must be created at repository root to separate source code from documentation. The specs/ folder contains only documentation artifacts (plan.md, tasks.md, etc.), while the simics-project/ folder at repo root contains the actual implementation.

## Phase 0: Outline & Research

### Step 0.1: Identify Research Needs
Extract unknowns from Technical Context above:
- For each NEEDS CLARIFICATION → research task
- For each dependency → best practices task
- For each integration → patterns task

### Step 0.2: Execute Discovery MCP Tools (Simics Projects)

**MANDATORY for Simics projects - Execute these tools immediately**:

1. **Environment Discovery** (MANDATORY):
   - Execute `get_simics_version()` → resolve Simics Version NEEDS CLARIFICATION
   - Execute `list_installed_packages()` → resolve Required Packages NEEDS CLARIFICATION
   - Execute `list_simics_platforms()` → resolve Available Platforms NEEDS CLARIFICATION

2. **Documentation Access via RAG** (MANDATORY):
   - Execute `perform_rag_query("DML 1.4 reference manual register and device modeling", source_type="docs", match_count=5)` → get DML 1.4 language reference excerpts
   - Execute `perform_rag_query("Simics Model Builder device creation and structure patterns", source_type="docs", match_count=5)` → get device modeling patterns
   - Execute `perform_rag_query("DML device template base structure and skeleton", source_type="dml", match_count=5)` → get base device structure patterns

3. **Device Example Analysis via RAG** (MANDATORY - use RAG queries for targeted examples):
   - Execute `perform_rag_query("Best practices for [DEVICE_NAME] device modeling with Simics DML 1.4", source_type="source", match_count=5)` → get device-specific patterns and best practices
   - Execute `perform_rag_query("Simics device implementation example [DEVICE_NAME] or similar peripheral", source_type="source", match_count=5)` → get Simics device patterns as reference
   - Execute `perform_rag_query("DML register bank implementation patterns", source_type="dml", match_count=5)` → get register implementation patterns and best practices

4. **Test Example Analysis via RAG** (MANDATORY - use RAG queries for test patterns):
   - Execute `perform_rag_query("Simics Python test patterns and examples", source_type="python", match_count=5)` → get Python test case patterns and structures
   - Execute `perform_rag_query("Simics device testing best practices", source_type="source", match_count=5)` → get device testing approaches and validation strategies

5. **Additional RAG Documentation Search** (recommended - query knowledge gaps):
   - **Review Functional Requirements**: Examine the "Functional Requirements" section in the feature spec (`specs/[###-feature-name]/spec.md`)
   - **Identify Knowledge Gaps**: For each functional requirement, determine what knowledge is NOT covered by the 8 mandatory queries above
   - **Execute Targeted Queries**: Use `perform_rag_query(query, source_type, match_count)` for each knowledge gap:
     * **Requirement-Specific Queries**: Query for specific hardware features, interfaces, or behaviors mentioned in requirements
     * **Pattern Queries**: Search for implementation patterns for specific device capabilities (e.g., "DMA implementation patterns", "interrupt handling in DML")
     * **Integration Queries**: Search for examples of devices with similar integration requirements (e.g., "PCI device configuration space", "memory-mapped I/O patterns")
   - **Source Type Selection**:
     * `source_type="dml"` for DML device modeling examples specific to requirements
     * `source_type="python"` for Python test case patterns for specific behaviors
     * `source_type="source"` for combined DML and test examples
     * `source_type="docs"` for general Simics documentation on specific topics
     * `source_type="all"` for comprehensive search across all sources
   - **Best Practices**: Use `match_count=5` for focused results; increase to 10 for complex requirements
   - **Document Rationale**: In research.md, document why each additional query was needed and which requirement(s) it addresses

**CRITICAL**: DO NOT execute implementation tools (`create_simics_project()`, `add_dml_device_skeleton()`, `build_simics_project()`) - those belong in Phase 3 (Implementation).

### Step 0.3: Parse MCP Tool and RAG Query Outputs

Extract key information from MCP tool JSON and RAG query responses:
- **get_simics_version()** → Extract Simics version for Technical Context
- **list_installed_packages()** → Extract package list for Technical Context
- **list_simics_platforms()** → Extract platform list for Technical Context
- **RAG queries for documentation** → Extract key patterns, best practices, and reference information
- **RAG queries for device examples** → Extract pattern insights, code structures, and architecture approaches
  * **CRITICAL**: Extract and include actual code examples from RAG results:
    - Parse the JSON response `results[].content` field to locate code snippets
    - Look for code patterns: lines containing `dml 1.4;`, `device`, `bank`, `register`, `field`, `method`, etc.
    - Extract 10-20 lines of actual DML code per example (not just descriptions)
    - Format as markdown code blocks with ```dml fencing
    - Example: If RAG returns "device contraption; bank regs { register r0 ... }", extract and format it as a proper code block
    - DO NOT write descriptions like "Sample timer device with counter" - show the actual code
- **RAG queries for test patterns** → Extract test structures, validation approaches, and Python test examples
  * **CRITICAL**: Extract and include actual Python test code snippets:
    - Parse the JSON response `results[].content` field to locate Python test code
    - Look for Python patterns: `def test_`, `simics.SIM_create_object()`, `dev_util.Register_LE()`, `stest.expect_equal()`
    - Extract 10-20 lines of actual Python test code per example (not just descriptions)
    - Format as markdown code blocks with ```python fencing
    - Example: If RAG returns test code with device creation and assertions, extract and format the actual Python code
    - DO NOT write descriptions like "Tests that create devices" - show the actual test code
- **Additional RAG searches** → Extract code examples, implementation patterns, and design recommendations

### Step 0.4: Create research.md File

**MANDATORY**: Create `[SPECS_DIR]/research.md` with this exact structure:

```markdown
# Research: [FEATURE_NAME]

## DML Learning Prerequisites (Simics Projects Only)

**⚠️ CRITICAL FOR SIMICS PROJECTS**: Two comprehensive DML learning documents must be studied in the tasks phase before writing any DML code:

1. `.specify/memory/DML_Device_Development_Best_Practices.md` - Patterns and pitfalls
2. `.specify/memory/DML_grammar.md` - Complete DML 1.4 language specification

**During /plan Phase**:
- ✅ Execute RAG queries for device patterns and examples
- ✅ Document RAG results in research.md
- ❌ DO NOT read the DML learning documents yet (they will be studied in tasks phase)

**In Tasks Phase**: Mandatory tasks T013-T014 will require complete study of these documents with comprehensive note-taking in research.md before any implementation

**For Software Projects**:
- Entity name, fields, relationships
- Validation rules from requirements
- State transitions if applicable

**For Simics Projects**:
- Register definitions (address, size, access type, reset value)
- Device state variables and attributes
- Interface specifications
- Memory-mapped regions

Use this structure:
```markdown
# Data Model: [FEATURE_NAME]

## Registers (Simics Projects)

### Register: [REGISTER_NAME]
- **Offset**: [hex address]
- **Size**: [bits]
- **Access**: [RO/WO/RW]
- **Reset Value**: [hex value]
- **Purpose**: [description]
- **Fields**: [bit fields if applicable]

## Device State (Simics Projects)

### State Variable: [NAME]
- **Type**: [type]
- **Purpose**: [description]
- **Persistence**: [checkpointed/transient]

## Interfaces (Simics Projects)

### Interface: [INTERFACE_NAME]
- **Type**: [Simics interface type]
- **Methods**: [list methods]
- **Purpose**: [description]
```

### Step 1.2: Create contracts/ directory

**MANDATORY**: Create `[SPECS_DIR]/contracts/` directory with contract specifications:

**For Software Projects**:
- API contracts (REST/GraphQL endpoints)
- Request/response schemas
- Error codes and messages

**For Simics Projects**:
- Register access contracts (read/write behavior)
- Interface behavior specifications
- Memory transaction patterns

Create files like:
- `contracts/register-access.md` - Register read/write specifications
- `contracts/interface-behavior.md` - Interface method contracts

### Step 1.3: Generate contract tests (planning only)

**Note**: Don't create test files yet - just plan them in contracts/

**For Simics Projects**: Document expected register read/write behavior tests:
- Reference device test patterns from research.md Device Example Analysis section
- Use test patterns discovered via `perform_rag_query()` for [DEVICE_NAME] and similar devices
- Extract test structure patterns from RAG search results (simple and complex device references)

### Step 1.4: Extract test scenarios from user stories

Identify integration test scenarios:
- Each user story → integration test scenario
- Quickstart validation steps

**For Simics Projects**: Device operational workflow tests

### Step 1.5: Create quickstart.md

**MANDATORY**: Create `[SPECS_DIR]/quickstart.md` with user validation guide:

**CRITICAL RULES for quickstart.md**:
- ❌ DO NOT use MCP tool syntax (no `create_simics_project()` calls)
- ❌ DO NOT assume implementation details (no specific register names until implemented)
- ✅ DO use generic descriptions ("Create Simics project", "Build device module")
- ✅ DO focus on Simics CLI commands users will actually run
- ✅ DO use placeholders: `[DEVICE_NAME]`, `[REGISTER_NAME]` for unknowns
- ✅ DO include validation criteria: "What constitutes success for each step?"

Use this structure:
```markdown
# Quick Start: [FEATURE_NAME]

## Goal
[One sentence: What will users accomplish by following this guide?]

## Prerequisites
[Environment requirements from research.md - actual versions/packages found]
- Simics Base [version from research.md]
- Required packages: [list from research.md]

## Validation Steps

### Step 1: [First User Story Validation]
**What to do**:
[Conceptual steps - no specific implementation commands]

**Expected Result**:
[What should happen]

**Success Criteria**:
[How to verify it worked - observable behavior]

### Step 2: [Second User Story Validation]
**What to do**:
[Reference that implementation will create the necessary files]

**Expected Result**:
[What should happen]

**Success Criteria**:
[How to verify it worked]

## Troubleshooting
[Common failure modes and how to debug them]

## Next Steps
[References to contracts/, data-model.md, and tasks.md]
```

### Step 1.6: Update agent context file

**MANDATORY**: Run `.specify/scripts/bash/update-agent-context.sh windsurf`

**IMPORTANT**: Execute it exactly as specified above. Do not add or remove any arguments.

This updates the agent-specific file (e.g., `ADK.md` for ADK agent) with:
- New technologies from current plan
- Preserved manual additions between markers
- Updated recent changes (keep last 3)
- Kept under 150 lines for token efficiency

### Step 1.7: Update Progress Tracking in plan.md

**MANDATORY**: Update the Progress Tracking section in plan.md. Mark these checkboxes:

```markdown
**Phase Status**:
- [x] Phase 0: Research complete (/plan command)
- [x] Phase 1: Design complete (/plan command)

**Gate Status**:
- [x] Post-Design Constitution Check: PASS
- [x] All NEEDS CLARIFICATION resolved
```

### Step 1.8: Re-evaluate Constitution Check

After completing design artifacts, re-check constitutional compliance:
- Review data-model.md against constitution principles
- Verify design doesn't introduce violations
- If new violations: Document in Complexity Tracking section
- If violations cannot be justified: Refactor design and return to Step 1.1

### Step 1.9: Validation Checkpoint

**MANDATORY**: Before proceeding, verify all Phase 1 deliverables exist:

```bash
ls -la [SPECS_DIR]/data-model.md
ls -la [SPECS_DIR]/quickstart.md
ls -la [SPECS_DIR]/contracts/
ls -la ADK.md  # or agent-specific file
```

Checklist:
- [ ] data-model.md file exists and contains register/entity definitions
- [ ] contracts/ directory exists with contract specifications
- [ ] quickstart.md file exists with user validation steps
- [ ] Agent context file updated (ADK.md or equivalent)
- [ ] Progress Tracking shows Phase 1 marked complete
- [ ] Constitution check passed (no new violations)

### Step 1.10: Announce Phase Completion

Explicitly state in your response:
```
✅ Phase 1 (Design) complete. Ready for /tasks command.

**Phase 1 Summary**:
- data-model.md created: ✅
- contracts/ created: ✅
- quickstart.md created: ✅
- Agent context updated: ✅
- Constitutional compliance: ✅
```

**Output**: data-model.md, /contracts/*, quickstart.md, agent-specific context file (e.g., ADK.md)

   **Quickstart.md Structure**:
   ```
   # Quick Start: [FEATURE_NAME]

   ## Goal
   [One sentence: What will users accomplish by following this guide?]

   ## Prerequisites
   [Environment requirements from research.md - actual versions/packages found]

   ## Validation Steps
   ### Step 1: [First User Story Validation]
   [What to do]
   **Expected Result**: [What should happen]
   **Success Criteria**: [How to verify it worked]

   ### Step 2: [Second User Story Validation]
   [What to do - no implementation details, reference tasks that will create them]
   **Expected Result**: [What should happen]
   **Success Criteria**: [How to verify it worked]

   ## Troubleshooting
   [Common failure modes and how to debug them]

   ## Next Steps
   [References to contracts/, data-model.md, and tasks.md]
   ```

6. **Update agent file incrementally** (O(1) operation):
   - Run `.specify/scripts/bash/update-agent-context.sh windsurf`
     **IMPORTANT**: Execute it exactly as specified above. Do not add or remove any arguments.
   - If exists: Add only NEW tech from current plan
   - Preserve manual additions between markers
   - Update recent changes (keep last 3)
   - Keep under 150 lines for token efficiency
   - Output to repository root

**Output**: data-model.md, /contracts/*, failing tests, quickstart.md, agent-specific file

## Phase 2: Task Planning Approach
*This section describes what the /tasks command will do - DO NOT execute during /plan*

**Task Generation Strategy**:
- Load `.specify/templates/tasks-template.md` as base
- Generate tasks from Phase 1 design docs (contracts, data model, quickstart)
- Each contract → contract test task [P]
- Each entity → model creation task [P]
- Each user story → integration test task
- Implementation tasks to make tests pass
- **Simics projects**: Include implementation MCP tool tasks:
  - **Setup tasks**: `create_simics_project()`, `add_dml_device_skeleton()`
  - **Build tasks**: `build_simics_project()`
  - **Test tasks**: `run_simics_test()`
  - **Note**: Discovery MCP tools (`get_simics_version`, `list_installed_packages`) already executed in /plan phase

**Ordering Strategy**:
- TDD order: Tests before implementation
- Dependency order: Models before services before UI
- Mark [P] for parallel execution (independent files)

**Estimated Output**: 25-30 numbered, ordered tasks in tasks.md

**IMPORTANT**: This phase is executed by the /tasks command, NOT by /plan

## Phase 3+: Future Implementation
*These phases are beyond the scope of the /plan command*

**Phase 3**: Task execution (/tasks command creates tasks.md)
**Phase 4**: Implementation (execute tasks.md following constitutional principles)
**Phase 5**: Validation (run tests, execute quickstart.md, performance validation)

## Completion Validation (MANDATORY)

Before reporting /plan command completion, the agent MUST verify ALL these conditions:

### Phase 0 Verification Checklist
Run these checks to verify Phase 0 is complete:

```bash
# Verify research.md exists
ls -la [SPECS_DIR]/research.md

# Verify no NEEDS CLARIFICATION remains
grep "NEEDS CLARIFICATION" [SPECS_DIR]/plan.md
```

- [ ] research.md file exists and contains MCP tool outputs
- [ ] Technical Context in plan.md has NO "NEEDS CLARIFICATION" text
- [ ] Progress Tracking shows "Phase 0: Research complete" checked
- [ ] All Simics Discovery MCP Tool Status checkboxes marked (if Simics project)
- [ ] MCP tool outputs are documented in research.md with proper structure

### Phase 1 Verification Checklist
Run these checks to verify Phase 1 is complete:

```bash
# Verify all Phase 1 files exist
ls -la [SPECS_DIR]/data-model.md
ls -la [SPECS_DIR]/quickstart.md
ls -la [SPECS_DIR]/contracts/
ls -la ADK.md  # or agent-specific file
```

- [ ] data-model.md file exists with register/entity definitions
- [ ] contracts/ directory exists with contract specifications
- [ ] quickstart.md file exists with user validation steps (NO MCP tool syntax)
- [ ] Agent context file updated (ADK.md, CLAUDE.md, or equivalent)
- [ ] Progress Tracking shows "Phase 1: Design complete" checked
- [ ] Post-Design Constitution Check shows PASS

### Overall Completion Checklist

- [ ] Both Phase 0 and Phase 1 are complete
- [ ] All generated files follow their respective templates
- [ ] No ERROR states in execution flow
- [ ] All MANDATORY steps completed
- [ ] Ready for /tasks command

## Final Report Format (MANDATORY)

After completing ALL verification checks, the agent MUST provide this exact report format:

```
✅ /plan command complete

**Branch**: [branch_name from setup script]

**Files Created**:
- ✅ plan.md (updated with resolved Technical Context and Progress Tracking)
- ✅ research.md (MCP tool outputs, device examples, architecture decisions)
- ✅ data-model.md (register definitions, device state, interfaces)
- ✅ quickstart.md (user validation guide - no MCP syntax)
- ✅ contracts/ (register access contracts, interface specifications)
- ✅ [agent-file].md (updated agent context - e.g., ADK.md, CLAUDE.md)

**Phase Status**:
- ✅ Phase 0 (Research): Complete
- ✅ Phase 1 (Design): Complete
- ⏭️  Phase 2 (Task Planning): Approach described in plan.md
- 📋 Phase 2 Execution: Ready for /tasks command

**Progress Summary**:
- Constitutional checks: [PASS/ISSUES]
- MCP tools executed: [count] tools
- RAG searches performed: [count] searches
- NEEDS CLARIFICATION resolved: [count] items
- Files generated: [count] files
- Total phases completed: 2 of 2

**Generated Artifacts**:
```
[SPECS_DIR]/
├── plan.md              # ✅ Updated
├── research.md          # ✅ Created
├── data-model.md        # ✅ Created
├── quickstart.md        # ✅ Created
└── contracts/           # ✅ Created
    ├── register-access.md
    └── interface-behavior.md
```

**Next Steps**:
1. Review the generated artifacts in `[SPECS_DIR]/`
2. Run `/tasks` to generate actionable task breakdown from design artifacts
3. The /tasks command will create tasks.md based on plan.md, data-model.md, and contracts/

**Ready For**: `/tasks` command execution
```

**CRITICAL**: Do NOT report completion until BOTH Phase 0 and Phase 1 are fully complete with all files created and verified.

## Complexity Tracking
*Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified*

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| [e.g., 4th project] | [current need] | [why 3 projects insufficient] |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient] |
