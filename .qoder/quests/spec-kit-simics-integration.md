# Spec-Kit Simics Integration Design

## Overview

This design outlines the integration of spec-kit's specification-driven development methodology with Intel Simics device modeling platform. The integration extends spec-kit's existing CLI framework to support Simics-specific device model development workflows, enabling specification-driven creation of device models, virtual platforms, and simulation environments.

The integration addresses the unique challenges of hardware simulation modeling where requirements often span multiple abstraction levels - from high-level behavioral specifications to low-level register-accurate implementations. By applying spec-kit's methodology to Simics development, teams can maintain consistency between device specifications and their simulation implementations while supporting iterative refinement of complex hardware models.

### Repository Type Classification

Based on analysis, spec-kit is classified as a **CLI Tool** - a command-line utility that provides project scaffolding, template management, and workflow automation for specification-driven development. The Simics integration extends this foundation to support hardware device modeling workflows.

## Architecture

### Integration Architecture

The Simics integration follows spec-kit's existing command-based architecture while adding domain-specific capabilities for device modeling:
